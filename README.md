# Easy DOE - Simplified DOE Generation App
## Introduction

Easy DOE simplifies the generation process of Design of Experiments (DOE) based on Latin Hypercube for various applications, including Soft Sensor development and multivariate analysis. With an intuitive interface, Easy DOE empowers users to efficiently create DOE configurations, facilitating data exploration and experimentation in diverse industries.

## Importance of DOE in Data Analysis

DOE plays a crucial role in optimizing processes, understanding complex systems, and identifying key factors affecting outcomes. In data analysis, it helps in efficient parameter exploration, model calibration, and sensitivity analysis. Easy DOE streamlines this process, making it accessible to researchers, engineers, and analysts

## Key Features of Easy DOE

- **Simple Generation:** Intuitively generate DOE configurations based on Latin Hypercube sampling.
- **Application Scope:** Tailored for Soft Sensor development and multivariate analysis, accommodating both continuous and discrete values.
- **Ease of Use:** User-friendly interface ensures seamless navigation and configuration.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing Python, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the Easy DOE repository to your local machine..

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Within the project directory, locate the `requirements.txt` file containing all necessary libraries. Install them by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
This will install all dependencies required to run Easy DOE.

## Execution

To run the application, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the project directory where `main.py` is located.

* Execute the `main.py` file using Python: **python main.py**

* After running the command, Dash will start the local server and you can access the application through your browser. Normally, the URL will be something like `http://127.0.0.45:8080/`.

## Examples

* In the [Examples](https://github.com/Spogis/EasyDOE/tree/master/Examples) directory, you will find example datasets that can assist you.
